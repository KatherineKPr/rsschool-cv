## 3. Summary

I am a 2nd-year student of the **BSUIR** (Computer Systems and Networks faculty).
For now my goal is to go deep into __*web-programming*__. Why? I like learning new about technologies, it always inspires me as well as beautiful pages on the Internet. Honestly I realized that this field attracts me. It all started with the fact that I went to the site of *[htmlacademy](https://htmlacademy.ru/courses)* and started doing exercises. I was inspired by the results, web-pages were simple but beautiful. From that moment I began to learn more and more about HTML and CSS. And I'm still not disappointed with my choice. __*I like it!*__ 
If I like something I can __*learn fast*__ and __*work hard*__ to improve myself. When programming I keep following one unbreakable rule: "*When you're in doubt ~~StackOverflow~~ Googl it*".
Also I consider it necessary to note that it won't be a problem for me to __*work in team*__ or just speak with people.

### Extra information
* #### Reading:
    - Not so long ago I have read *[this](https://habr.com/ru/company/piter/blog/323310/)* useful book about the algorithms
